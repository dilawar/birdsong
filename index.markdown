This cython application __chidiya__ (चिड़िया) -- Hindustani for bird -- is a work in
progress. It claims to do the following:

- Read recorded bird-songs (`aiff` file format). 
- Extract `notes` and store them in XML file.
- Process stored notes in an XML file and cluster them according to temporal
  variation. It calls them song.
